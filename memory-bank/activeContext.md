## Current Focus
Rewriting the frontend from scratch using **Atomic Design Pattern**. Old client components have been completely cleaned out. Building a systematic, scalable frontend architecture from the ground up.

The server is fully functional — we are only focusing on the frontend.

All milestones 1-3 are complete. Auth flow, dashboard layout, profile page, and settings page are built. Next: order management.

## Recent Changes
- **ESLint Warnings Fixed** (`be93c75`) — Fixed all 5 `import/prefer-default-export` warnings. Converted `useAuth`, `useDebounce`, `useForm`, `lib/index`, `services/index`, and `authService` from named exports to default exports. Updated all 12 importing files. ESLint now passes with 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- **useForm Hook + onChange Validation** (`d402491`) — Built professional `useForm` hook (state + debounced onChange + touched state + onSubmit validation). Created `useDebounce` generic hook. All 6 auth forms refactored to use `getFieldProps` + `handleSubmit` pattern. Zod validation rules synced with server (password min 8, phone regex, email notEmpty, English messages).
- **Zod Validation Integration** (`1e3b801`) — Replaced all manual inline validation in 6 auth forms with centralized Zod schemas. Created `lib/schemas/` with reusable schemas and `formatZodErrors` helper.
- **Vercel React Best Practices Applied** (`feae766`) — 22 files optimized with `useCallback`, `useMemo`, memo, early returns, event handler refs, and other Vercel performance patterns
- **Storybook Runtime Errors Fixed** (`0dc5646`) — Fixed broken stories (Input, Card, Modal) and added missing stories (DashboardHome, Header, AuthTemplate, DashboardTemplate)
- **Self-Contained Modal Auth Forms** (`9e3ed40`) — Refactored each auth form to be an independent modal with its own `open`/`onClose` props, removing the single-modal approach with step management. Each form now pops up as its own modal.
- **Emoji → SVG Icon Component** (`c76b293`, `af5118d`) — Replaced emoji icons with the new SVG `Icon` component in Sidebar, ProfileCompletionForm, and DashboardHome
- **COMPLETE DESIGN SYSTEM OVERHAUL** — Premium Dental Lab aesthetic
  - Colors: Cold blue → Warm gold/terracotta/cream palette
  - Typography: Inter → Lalezar (display/Arabic) + Fraunces (serif/English) + Sora (body)
  - CSS: Added geometric diamond pattern overlay + noise texture
  - Warm-toned shadows, gold focus rings, refined transitions
- **All 7 atom components redesigned** with new aesthetic:
  - **Button**: Gold gradient primary, terracotta secondary, shimmer animation, bounce transition, refined hover/active states
  - **Badge**: Warm semantic colors, uppercase label style
  - **Input**: Gold focus glow, warmer backgrounds, larger border radius
  - **Label**: Uppercase letter-spacing, warm typography
  - **Spinner**: Default gold color
  - **Typography**: Lalezar for h1/h2, Fraunces for h3-h5, Sora uppercase for h6/body
  - **Icon**: Works with warm palette via currentColor
- **Card molecule**: Updated gold hover border
- **7 new molecule components** created with Premium Dental Lab aesthetic:
  - **Avatar**: Image + initials fallback, 4 sizes (sm/md/lg/xl), gold border
  - **Toast**: Success/error/warning/info, slide-in animation, auto-dismiss, close button
  - **Modal**: Overlay + backdrop-filter blur, scale-in animation, sm/md/lg, ESC close
  - **Tabs**: Horizontal tab list, gold active indicator, disabled tab support
  - **Dropdown**: Custom select with options list, click-outside-to-close, gold focus
  - **Checkbox/Radio**: Styled control, gold checked state, label + error support
  - **Toggle**: iOS-style switch, sm/md sizes, bounce animation
- **Barrel export**: Updated `components/index.ts` with all new molecules
- **Plop template**: Fixed `index.ts.hbs` to include named exports
- **Design Tokens** (spacing.ts): Added half-step tokens (2.5, 3.5), warm shadows, bounce transition, gold shadow
- **COMPLETE AUTH INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT**:
  - Axios + Sonner installation
  - API client (`lib/api.ts`) — base URL + interceptors
  - Auth service (`services/authService.ts`) — all endpoint wrappers
  - AuthContext (`context/AuthContext.tsx`) — global auth state
  - `useAuth` + `useAuthModal` hooks
- **ALL ORGANISM COMPONENTS CREATED** (10 total):
  - **AuthModal** — Orchestrator that renders each auth form as a self-contained modal popup (login/register/verify/forgot-password/reset-password)
  - **LoginForm, RegisterForm, EmailVerificationForm** — Auth modal forms
  - **ForgotPasswordForm, ResetPasswordForm** — Password reset flow (inside modal)
  - **Header** — Logo + "Sign In" button / user menu
  - **ProfileCompletionForm** — Role selection (Dentist/Technician) + conditional fields
  - **Sidebar** — Role-based navigation (Dentist: orders/new order, Technician: orders)
  - **DashboardHome** — Stats overview
- **TEMPLATES**: AuthTemplate (landing page), DashboardTemplate (sidebar+header+content)
- **PAGES**: Root page (`/`) → AuthTemplate, Dashboard (`/dashboard`) → auto profile check
- **ROOT LAYOUT**: AuthProvider + Toaster at global level
- Previous changes (Plop, Storybook, etc.) still in place

## Hard Rules
- **Package Manager: yarn ONLY** — Never use npm. All installs, scripts, and workspace commands use yarn.
- **Branch Scope Discipline** — When a branch is created for a specific task (e.g., `refactor/frontend-rewrite`), ONLY work on that scope. Never touch unrelated code (e.g., backend while on a frontend branch). This prevents merge conflicts.
- **Professional Code Quality** — "It works" is not enough. Code must be readable, maintainable, and professional. Standards are non-negotiable.
- **Discussion-First Approach** — Every change is discussed first. No silent coding. Every decision has a rationale. If an approach compromises code quality, alternatives are presented and debated.
- **No Silent Commits** — Every commit must have a clear purpose and scope. Meaningless messages like "WIP", "fix", "update" are prohibited.

## Active Decisions
- **Atomic Design Pattern**: `atoms/` → `molecules/` → `organisms/` → `templates/` → `pages/` hierarchy
- **Each component in its own folder**: `ComponentName/index.tsx` + `ComponentName.module.css`
- **CSS Modules** for styling
- **Design Tokens** for consistent design language
- **Server API is unchanged** — client is built to match existing endpoints
- **AuthContext** for global auth state (Context API)
- **Custom hooks** for logic/UI separation (useAuth, useForm)
- **Storybook** for component development and documentation
- **Plop** for code scaffolding to enforce consistency
- **zod** for client-side form validation
- **@antfu/eslint-config** for code quality
- **Future: i18n** — Arabic + English UI support
- **Future: WebSocket** — Socket.IO for real-time notifications
- **Future: Global State Management** — beyond simple Context API

## Known Issues (Backend)
- Server is working, not touching it

## Known Issues (Frontend — To Be Resolved in This Branch)
1. ~~Old `authService.ts` endpoints did not match the server — to be rewritten from scratch~~ ✅ Resolved
2. ~~`rigister` typo — to be fixed in atomic design rewrite~~ ✅ Resolved
3. ~~Broken icon imports — resolved with new Icon atom~~ ✅ Resolved
4. ~~Missing auth guard — added with AuthContext + protected routes~~ ✅ Resolved
5. Emoji usage in some components should be replaced with SVG Icon component — ongoing
6. Storybook stories for all organisms and templates — mostly done, verify coverage
7. Order management frontend does not exist yet — future task
